# GoloSwift

Our framework is written in Swift 4 and is designed to work with the blockchain [Golos.io](https://golos.io/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

#### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'GoloSwift', :git => "https://github.com/Monserg/GoloSwift.git"
end
```

Then, run the following command in `Terminal`:

```
$ pod update 'GoloSwift'
```
